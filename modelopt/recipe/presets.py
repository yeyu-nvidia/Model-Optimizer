"""PTQ quant-config preset discovery shared by the PTQ example scripts.

The example PTQ entry points (``examples/hf_ptq/hf_ptq.py``,
``examples/hf_ptq/multinode_ptq.py``, ``examples/megatron_bridge/quantize.py``)
expose a ``--qformat`` / ``--kv_cache_qformat`` (``--quant_cfg`` /
``--kv_cache_quant`` for Megatron-Bridge) CLI vocabulary. Rather than hardcoding a
name → config table in each script, the vocabulary is discovered by listing the
YAML presets shipped under ``modelopt_recipes/configs/ptq/presets/{model,kv}/``:
every ``*.yaml`` basename is a valid format name, and the directory listing is the
single source of truth. Adding a preset YAML exposes it on all three CLIs with no
code change.

:data:`QUANT_CFG_CHOICES` and :data:`KV_QUANT_CFG_CHOICES` are the ready-to-use
mappings; :func:`load_quant_cfg_choices` builds equivalent mappings for custom
preset directories. Configs are loaded eagerly into plain dicts at import; callers
that mutate a returned config must deepcopy it first (this mirrors how the
``mtq.*_CFG`` module constants — themselves eagerly-loaded shared dicts — are used).
