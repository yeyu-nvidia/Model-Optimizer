"""End-to-end regression guard for the GPT-OSS MXFP4 -> NVFP4 cast path.

This exercises the exact combination that silently regressed (nvbug 6295279 / 6295242):
a transposed-quantize MoE (``GptOssExperts``) with **static-block** NVFP4 weight quantizers
-- which is what ``examples/hf_ptq --cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4`` produces via
``force_weight_quantizers_static`` -- calibrated with a forward loop.

The regression (the unconditional ``weight_only_quantize`` from #1560 feeding the
*non-transposed* expert weight while the forward feeds the transposed one) raised
``ValueError: Input shape has changed`` during ``mtq.quantize``. Without the
``iter_weights_for_calibration`` fix this test fails at ``mtq.quantize`` below.

Static-block NVFP4 fake quant uses a Triton kernel, so this is GPU-only.
