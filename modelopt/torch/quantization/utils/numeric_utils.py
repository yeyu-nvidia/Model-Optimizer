"""Closed-form numerics for the bit-exact MXFP4 -> NVFP4 weight cast.

These helpers turn an MXFP4 source layer's E8M0 block scales into the per-tensor
``global_amax`` and per-NVFP4-block ``amax`` that pin NVFP4's two-level scale so
the cast reproduces the source MXFP4 weights bit-for-bit (see PR #1372 for the
derivation). They are pure tensor math with no model or checkpoint dependencies,
shared by the GPT-OSS (``examples/hf_ptq``) and DeepSeek-V4
(``examples/deepseek``) PTQ cast paths.

    Each MXFP4 block of 32 elements has one E8M0 exponent ``k_j``. Two cases
    based on whether ``k_j`` fits in NVFP4's E4M3 scale grid (with
    ``m = k_max - 8`` chosen by ``mxfp4_to_nvfp4_global_amax``):

    - **In-range** (``k_j - m`` in ``[-9, 8]``): ``6 * 2^k_j`` (closed-form
      ideal). The resulting per-block scale ``2^(k_j - m)`` is exactly
      representable in E4M3 — no rounding loss — and
      ``round_to_E2M1(value / 2^k_j)`` yields the original MXFP4 nibble
      verbatim. Bit-exact reconstruction.

    - **Out of range** (``|k_j - m| > 8/9``): ``max_nibble * 2^k_j``, i.e.
      ``max(|w_block|)`` where ``w`` is the MXFP4-dequantized block. This is
      the data-derived per-block amax. The per-block scale will still get
      clamped at the E4M3 boundary, but data-derived amax keeps the post-clamp
      scale closer to the block's actual magnitude than the closed-form ideal
      would, which reduces re-bucketing error for OOR blocks where
      ``max_nibble < 6``.
