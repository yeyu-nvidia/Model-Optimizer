0.46 (2026-08-xx)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Remove the ``examples/diffusers/eval`` image-quality evaluation example (ImageReward / CLIP-IQA / CLIP metrics) and its references in ``examples/diffusers/README.md``. The example was deprecated in 0.45 and is no longer maintained.

**Deprecations**

- Consolidated ``examples/vlm_ptq`` into ``examples/llm_ptq``. Vision-language model PTQ now shares the ``hf_ptq.py`` entry point and ``scripts/huggingface_example.sh``; pass ``--vlm`` to run the TensorRT-LLM multimodal quickstart smoke test. The ``examples/vlm_ptq/scripts/huggingface_example.sh`` entry point is deprecated: it now prints a warning and forwards to the ``llm_ptq`` script with ``--vlm``, and will be removed in a future release. See `examples/llm_ptq/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq#vlm-quantization>`__.
- Dropped VILA / NVILA vision-language model support in ``examples/llm_ptq``. VILA's modeling code requires ``transformers<=4.50.0``, which conflicts with ModelOpt's minimum supported ``transformers`` version. The VILA-specific bootstrap (repo clone, ``requirements-vila.txt``) and loading paths in ``example_utils.py`` have been removed.

**New Features**

- Add the **D-PACE** loss objective for DFlash speculative-decoding training (`arXiv:2605.18810 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2605.18810>`_) and make it the default (``dflash_loss_objective: dpace``). It replaces the static exponential position decay with dynamic, confidence-derived per-position weights that adapt to whichever block positions currently limit acceptance. Smoothing is controlled by ``dflash_dpace_alpha`` (default 0.5); set ``dflash_loss_objective: decay`` to restore the previous static schedule. Training-only and detached from the gradient (no architecture or inference change).
- Add the ``day0-release`` agent skill (``.agents/skills/day0-release/``), a deterministic end-to-end driver that chains the PTQ → evaluation → comparison skills (the evaluation stage deploys the checkpoint itself) with an enforced gate after each stage and returns a publish decision (ACCEPT / REGRESSION / ANOMALOUS / INFEASIBLE). Ships three GPU-free, unit-tested gate scripts (``gate_ptq.py``, ``gate_run.py``, ``gate_compare.py``) that validate checkpoint coverage, evaluation-run completeness, and baseline-vs-candidate accuracy threshold. v1 reports and stops on regression; the recipe-search loop is deferred.
- Add **streaming** speculative-decoding training (EAGLE3 / DFlash): the draft trains on base-model hidden states produced on the fly by a co-located ``vllm serve`` (no disk dump), moved trainer-side over NIXL RDMA, scaling to multi-node (dedicated serve replicas + DDP trainers). New launcher examples for NVFP4 Kimi-K2.5 / K2.6 on GB200/aarch64 under ``tools/launcher/examples/moonshotai/``.
- Add a fused Triton fast path for ``local_hessian`` NVFP4 weight-scale search (the Hessian-weighted FP8-E4M3 scale sweep). For each NVFP4 block it minimizes ``dwᵀ H dw`` over the 126 candidate scales using the per-cin-block local Hessian on tensor cores, replacing the per-weight Python reference sweep — roughly **34x** faster on a single 8192x4096 weight and bit-exact with the reference for fp32/fp16 weights. Used automatically during ``local_hessian`` calibration for both dense and fused-MoE expert weights; falls back to the reference sweep on CPU, when Triton is unavailable, or via ``MODELOPT_NVFP4_TRITON_SWEEP=0``.
- Add Minitron pruning support for Megatron-Core models with the following new attention and MoE variants. For these, only ``hidden_size`` is pruned (alongside the usual ``ffn_hidden_size`` / ``num_layers`` / MoE dimensions); the variant-internal dimensions noted below are not pruned:

  - **GatedDeltaNet** (linear attention) and **gated attention** (``attention_output_gate``), such as Qwen3.5 (hybrid GatedDeltaNet + gated-attention) language models, including MoE variants — attention / linear-attention heads are not pruned.
  - **Multi-Latent Attention (MLA)**, such as DeepSeek — MLA latent ranks are not pruned.
  - **Latent MoE**, such as Nemotron-3-Super — ``hidden_size`` pruning resizes the latent projections while the MoE latent dim itself is not pruned.
- Add NVFP4 Four-Over-Six (4/6) weight quantization (``mtq.NVFP4_FOUR_OVER_SIX_CFG``): MSE weight calibration picks, per block, between an M=6 and an M=4 dynamic range (the choice is folded into the FP8 per-block scales), with the ``four_over_six: true`` flag normalizing those scales by 256 (vs 448) for M=4 headroom. Supported via ``mtq.quantize`` and HF / Megatron export only -- **not** ``mtq.compress``, which does not preserve the per-block M=4/M=6 choice
- Add dLLM (tied-weight PTQ and HF-checkpoint export) support for diffusion-based encoder-decoder LLMs (e.g. DiffusionGemma) whose encoder/decoder stacks share parameters via HF ``_tied_weights_keys``.

  - **Deduplicate the modules shared at source** in the quantized export step: ``_export_quantized_weight`` and ``_export_fused_experts`` now alias bit-identical packed ``weight`` / ``weight_scale`` / ``weight_scale_2`` buffers across modules sharing a source weight ``data_ptr()`` so the downstream ``postprocess_state_dict`` dedup catches them (~42% storage reduction on ``nvfp4_experts_only`` for tied 26B MoE checkpoints).
  - New ``sync_tied_input_amax`` helper max-merges per-side ``input_quantizer.amax`` across tied modules before export so single-backbone consumers that load one ``input_scale`` per parameter don't clip either side.
  - The exported state_dict is also **reordered (decoder keys win instead of encoder)** so canonical-side keys per HF's ``_tied_weights_keys`` declaration win the data_ptr dedup; gated to the DiffusionGemma model class in ``_reorder_canonical_first``, no-op for every other model.
  - New DiffusionGemma model-specific recipe under ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/diffusion_gemma/ptq/`` (``nvfp4_experts_only.yaml`` + its ``disabled_quantizers.yaml`` unit) adds the ``*self_conditioning*`` exclude on top of the standard default, leaving the shared ``default_disabled_quantizers`` unit clean for non-diffusion models — pattern matches the existing ``phi4mm`` / ``nemotron_vl`` model-specific recipes.
  - ``hf_ptq.py`` also unwraps ``ModelOutput`` dataclasses from ``.generate()`` so the preview decode works on diffusion models. Non-tied models see no behavioral change.
- Add **context-parallel (CP)** and **data-parallel (DP)** support to the shared Megatron-Core inference/calibration utilities. Under CP, ``get_megatron_calibration_forward_loop`` and ``megatron_mmlu`` partition each sequence across CP ranks (zigzag load-balanced), ``megatron_prefill`` accepts a CP-partitioned ``position_ids`` and lets the CP-aware causal attention build the mask, and MMLU gathers per-rank logits back to the full sequence for last-token scoring. Under DP, calibration shards the dataset across data-parallel ranks (``DistributedSampler``; amax is max-reduced across the DP group inside ``mtq``) and ``megatron_mmlu`` shards whole batches across DP ranks and all-reduces the per-subject counts. DP is implicit (``world_size / (tp * pp * cp)``); ``examples/megatron_bridge/quantize.py`` gains a ``--cp_size`` flag.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix ``ShapeInferenceError`` during ONNX INT8 + FP16 quantization (``--high_precision_dtype fp16``) of weakly-typed models (e.g. TensorFlow exports) that carry stale rank-0 ``graph.output`` shapes or ops such as ``TopK`` that ONNX's static shape inference cannot resolve. ``clear_stale_value_info`` now reconciles stale output shapes via symbolic shape inference (keeping every output's shape field populated), and AutoCast runs ONNX shape inference in strict mode and falls back to schema-based standalone type inference when it fails, so unresolved ops no longer leave tensors untyped.
- Fused MoE expert auto-detection (``register_fused_experts_on_the_fly``) no longer requires an ``act_fn`` attribute. Some fused-expert modules (e.g. ``MiniMaxM3VLExperts``) apply a custom gated activation between the two ``F.linear`` calls instead of exposing ``act_fn``; they were silently skipped, leaving routed experts unquantized (an experts-only recipe matched nothing) and failing HF export with ``NotImplementedError``. ``_QuantFusedExperts`` is activation-agnostic (it only intercepts the two ``F.linear`` calls), so the requirement was unnecessary. This enables NVFP4/FP8 quantization and export for MiniMax-M2 / MiniMax-M3.

0.45 (2026-07-02)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New Features**

*Quantization*

- Add NVFP4 W4A16 weight-only quantization (``w4a16_nvfp4``): FP4 weights with group_size=16, BF16 activations, no calibration forward pass required. Use ``mtq.W4A16_NVFP4_CFG`` or ``--qformat w4a16_nvfp4`` in ``hf_ptq.py``. vLLM deployment support is in progress.
- Add ``--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4`` flag to ``examples/llm_ptq/hf_ptq.py`` for closed-form, bit-exact MXFP4 → NVFP4 weight conversion. Supports the GPT-OSS family (``openai/gpt-oss-20b``, ``openai/gpt-oss-120b``). See `examples/llm_ptq/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_ptq#mxfp4--nvfp4-cast-for-gpt-oss>`__ for usage.
- Add ``--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4`` flag to ``examples/deepseek/deepseek_v4/quantize_to_nvfp4.py`` for closed-form, bit-exact MXFP4 → NVFP4 conversion of DeepSeek V4 routed-expert weights (mirrors the GPT-OSS cast; w1/w3 share one per-tensor ``scale_2`` for the fused GEMM1). Activation ``input_scale`` still comes from ``--amax_path`` calibration.
- DeepSeek PTQ (``examples/deepseek/ptq.py``) now defaults to native top-k calibration with post-hoc per-layer peer-max sync of expert ``input_quantizer.amax``; the all-experts path is preserved behind ``--calib_all_experts``.
- Add active-MoE cost accounting for ``mtq.auto_quantize`` effective-bits search. Set ``constraints={"effective_bits": ..., "cost_model": "active_moe", "cost": {"active_moe_expert_ratio": ...}}`` to weight routed MoE expert costs by active experts per token while keeping shared experts fully counted. The ``hf_ptq.py`` AutoQuant path exposes this via ``--auto_quantize_cost_model active_moe`` and ``--auto_quantize_active_moe_expert_ratio``.
- Add quantized ``nn.Embedding`` support. ``nn.Embedding`` is now registered in ``QuantModuleRegistry`` and exposes ``weight_quantizer`` (embedding table), ``output_quantizer`` (lookup activations), and a permanently disabled ``input_quantizer`` placeholder — embedding inputs are integer indices and cannot be fake-quantized, so direct ``enable*()`` calls raise. ``export_hf_checkpoint`` packs quantized embedding weights alongside Linear layers. Embedding quantizers are opt-in (``parent_class: nn.Embedding`` disabled by default).
- Add composable ``$import`` system for recipe YAML configs, enabling reusable config snippets referenced via ``{$import: name}`` markers. All built-in PTQ recipes converted to use imports with shared snippets under ``modelopt_recipes/configs/`` (numeric formats, quant_cfg building blocks, presets). See :ref:`composable-imports`.
- The PTQ example scripts ``examples/llm_ptq/hf_ptq.py``, ``examples/llm_ptq/multinode_ptq.py`` and ``examples/megatron_bridge/quantize.py`` now derive their ``--qformat`` / ``--kv_cache_qformat`` (``--quant_cfg`` / ``--kv_cache_quant`` for Megatron-Bridge) CLI vocabularies by discovering the YAML presets under ``modelopt_recipes/configs/ptq/presets/{model,kv}/`` rather than carrying hardcoded ``QUANT_CFG_CHOICES`` / ``KV_QUANT_CFG_CHOICES`` tables. The discovery helper, alias table and ready-built ``QUANT_CFG_CHOICES`` / ``KV_QUANT_CFG_CHOICES`` mappings now live in ``modelopt.recipe.presets`` and are shared by all three scripts. Presets are loaded eagerly into a plain dict at import. Adding a new preset YAML makes it available on the CLI of all three with no script change — note this means each script now accepts every preset under those directories, not just a previously curated subset. All previously-supported short names (``int8_sq``, ``nvfp4_awq``, ``fp8_pb_wo``, ``nvfp4_mse``, ``w4a8_awq``, ``nvfp4_local_hessian``, ``fp8_pc_pt``, ``int8_wo``) keep working via a small deprecation alias table; new formats should be exposed as preset YAMLs (or, longer term, as full ``--recipe`` recipes).
- Add ``configs/ptq/presets/kv/fp8_cast.yaml`` and ``configs/ptq/presets/kv/nvfp4_cast.yaml``, promoting ``fp8_cast`` / ``nvfp4_cast`` to first-class KV presets composed from the existing ``kv_fp8_cast`` / ``kv_nvfp4_cast`` unit fragments. The previous runtime ``use_constant_amax`` post-edit in ``hf_ptq.py`` is removed; ``use_constant_amax: true`` now lives in the YAML and is therefore authoritative. **Custom (out-of-tree) recipes that target a cast KV format must set ``use_constant_amax: true`` themselves on the ``[kv]_bmm_quantizer`` config** — in-tree recipes already do via the ``kv_*_cast`` units.
- Add FP8 KV-cache cast variants for the partial-NVFP4 and weight-only general PTQ recipes: ``general/ptq/nvfp4_mlp_only-kv_fp8_cast``, ``general/ptq/nvfp4_experts_only-kv_fp8_cast``, ``general/ptq/nvfp4_omlp_only-kv_fp8_cast``, and ``general/ptq/nvfp4_weight_only-kv_fp8_cast``. These compose the same model-quant configs as their ``-kv_fp8`` siblings with the ``kv_fp8_cast`` unit (constant-amax FP8 KV cache, no KV calibration forward pass).
- Add Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B PTQ recipes ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/models/nvidia/Nemotron-3-Super-120B-A12B/ptq/nvfp4-mse.yaml`` (MSE-mixed) and ``nvfp4-max-calib.yaml`` (max-calib mixed): NVFP4 W4A4 routed experts + FP8 per-tensor shared experts / Mamba in/out_proj + FP8 KV cache.
- Group layerwise calibration options under a nested ``LayerwiseConfig`` and add two knobs: ``get_qdq_activations_from_prev_layer`` (correct GPTQ-Hessian vs max-calib activation semantics — defaults to True for GPTQ, False for max/mse/local_hessian) and ``save_every`` (gate per-window ``next_inputs.pt`` activation-cache writes). Legacy bool ``layerwise`` and flat ``layerwise_checkpoint_dir`` keys still work; the bool form emits a ``DeprecationWarning``.
- Add ``examples/alpamayo`` showing FP8, NVFP4, and AutoQuantize (mixed-precision) quantization of the Alpamayo (formerly Alpamayo-R1) ~10B vision-language-action model, with a joint VLM + diffusion calibration loop and both fake-quant and ``--real-quant`` packed-checkpoint export. See `examples/alpamayo/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/alpamayo>`_ for details.
- Refactor ``llm_qat`` example with unified YAML-based configuration and flexible dataset blending.
  ``ModelOptArgParser`` adds ``--config`` YAML support with CLI overrides and auto-generates ``ARGUMENTS.md`` from dataclass definitions.
  Dataset blending (``configs/dataset/blend.yaml``) supports HuggingFace datasets, local JSON/JSONL/Parquet files, and weighted multi-source blends.
  The legacy FSDP1 accelerate config is removed; ``llm_qat`` now documents FSDP2, DeepSpeed, and DDP backends.

*Megatron Framework (M-LM / M-Bridge)*

- Add quantization examples for the Megatron-Bridge framework (``examples/megatron_bridge/``): post-training quantization (`quantize.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/examples/megatron_bridge/quantize.py>`_ calibrates an HF model via ``--quant_cfg`` alias / full config name or a ``--recipe`` YAML, with optional KV-cache quant, weight-only, compression, and MoE expert-ratio calibration, and saves a Megatron checkpoint with tensor / pipeline / expert parallelism), export to a deployable HuggingFace (unified) checkpoint for TensorRT-LLM / vLLM / SGLang (`export.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/examples/megatron_bridge/export.py>`_), and Quantization Aware Distillation (extend existing `distill.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/examples/megatron_bridge/distill.py>`_). See `examples/megatron_bridge/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge>`_ for details.
- Add Megatron Core export/import mapping for Qwen3-VL (``Qwen3VLForConditionalGeneration``) vision-language models. The mapping handles the ``model.language_model.`` weight prefix used by Qwen3-VL.
- Add shared Megatron-Core calibration forward loop: ``modelopt.torch.utils.plugins.megatron_calibration.get_megatron_calibration_forward_loop`` produces the ``forward_loop`` callable expected by ``mtq.quantize`` / ``mtp.prune``. Replaces the bespoke calibration loops in Megatron-LM and Megatron-Bridge for quantization and pruning with a single canonical implementation.
- Support Megatron-Core checkpoint restore and export for MSE ``NVFP4StaticQuantizer``.
- Add mixed-precision FP8 + NVFP4 export for Megatron-Core: per-layer ``quant_algo`` recorded under ``quantized_layers`` in ``hf_quant_config.json``, PP-aware ``kv_cache_dtype`` gather, fused-QKV exclude split into per-HF-name ``q/k/v_proj`` entries.
- Add support for ``active_params`` (for MoE models) and ``memory_mb`` constraints in Minitron pruning on top of existing ``params`` constraint. You can also provide multiple constraints. See `examples/pruning/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning>`_ for more details. The underlying utility functions ``mcore_param_count``, ``mcore_memory_footprint_mb``, and ``print_mcore_model_stats`` in ``modelopt.torch.nas.plugins.megatron_model_stats`` are also available for standalone use to compute parameter counts and memory footprints (weights + KV-cache + Mamba state) for any Megatron-Core model.
- Add Minitron pruning support for Megatron-Bridge Gemma3 models.
- Add end-to-end optimization tutorial for Minitron pruning + two-phase distillation (80B @ 8K + 20B @ 32K long-context = 100B tokens) + FP8 PTQ + vLLM deployment for Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16 (MoE + Mamba-Transformer hybrid) → Pruned 22B/A3.0B active params, along with data blend preparation steps (with tool-calling data) and detailed pruning / data-blend / long-context ablations. See `examples/megatron_bridge/tutorials/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge/tutorials/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16/>`_ for details.

*Datasets & Calibration*

- Add ``DATASET_COMBOS`` to ``modelopt.torch.utils.dataset_utils`` — single ``--dataset`` tokens that fan out to multiple registered datasets; per-entry ``num_samples`` is split evenly across the members. Initial combos: ``cnn_nemotron_v2_mix`` (``cnn_dailymail`` + ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2``, used by ``hf_ptq.py`` when no ``--dataset`` is provided) and ``nemotron-post-training-v3`` (the seven ``nvidia/Nemotron-*`` SFT datasets added in #1498, mirroring the `nemotron-post-training-v3 collection <https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/nemotron-post-training-v3>`_). Combo names are listed by ``get_supported_datasets()`` and surfaced in ``--dataset`` help. ``get_dataset_dataloader`` rejects inputs that mix a combo with one of its member datasets (e.g. ``cnn_dailymail,cnn_nemotron_v2_mix``) to avoid double-sampling, and ``get_dataset_samples`` rejects combo names so callers route through the dataloader. ``hf_ptq.py`` default ``--calib_size`` is bumped from ``512`` to ``1024`` so the total calibration sample count under the new default combo matches the previous two-dataset fallback.
- The ``nemotron-sft-agentic-v2`` registered dataset (added in #1498) now uses only the ``search`` split. The previously configured ``interactive_agent`` and ``tool_calling`` splits contain content-level defects (heterogeneous schema and a malformed JSON row, respectively) that cause pyarrow's streaming JSON reader to fail deterministically.
- Add ``pack=True`` mode to ``get_dataset_dataloader`` (Megatron-LM pretraining-style global-stream document packing): all raw samples concatenated EOS-separated into one token stream, sliced into uniform ``max_sample_length`` rows. Used by the shared megatron calibration loop.

*Misc*

- Add offline DFlash speculative decoding training. Train the draft module from pre-computed base-model hidden states dumped by ``examples/speculative_decoding/collect_hidden_states/compute_hidden_states_hf.py``; base-model transformer layers are deleted after conversion to save memory. Controlled by the auto-derived ``dflash_offline`` flag on ``DFlashConfig`` (derived from ``data_args.offline_data_path``). The dump scripts now share ``collect_hidden_states/common.py`` for aux-layer selection (``--aux-layers eagle|dflash|<list>``) and optional assistant-token ``loss_mask`` for answer-only-loss training.
- Add ``mtsa.config.SKIP_SOFTMAX_TRITON_CALIB`` for skip-softmax attention-sparsity calibration through the fused Triton ``attention_calibrate`` kernel (HF ``modelopt_triton`` backend), measuring multi-threshold tile-skip statistics the way the Triton inference kernel actually skips tiles for both prefill and decode. Exposed as ``--sparse_attn_cfg skip_softmax_triton_calib`` in ``examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/hf_sa.py`` (with a new ``--calib_data_dir`` flag for RULER calibration data).
- Add DMD2 distillation for few-step diffusion models in ``examples/diffusers/fastgen/``: distill Qwen-Image into a 4/8-step student via Distribution Matching Distillation. See `examples/diffusers/fastgen/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/diffusers/fastgen>`_ for details.
- Make ``.agents/skills/`` the canonical location for agent skills; agent-specific directories (``.claude/skills/``, etc.) are now relative symlinks into ``.agents/``, so one skill suite serves multiple coding agents (Claude Code, Codex). See ``.agents/README.md``.
- Extend Claude Code agent skills for PTQ, deployment, evaluation, monitoring, and baseline-vs-quantized result comparison. Adds evaluation task references for additional benchmarks, stronger PTQ checkpoint validation gates, and session-scoped workspace/job tracking.
- Add SLURM Quality of Service (QoS) support to the ModelOpt launcher. Users can set QoS via ``slurm_config.qos`` or ``SLURM_QOS`` and the value is forwarded to ``nemo_run.SlurmExecutor``.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- ``KDTrainer`` / ``QADTrainer`` evaluation now reports KD as the primary
  ``eval_loss`` and CE as ``eval_ce_loss``; the previous secondary
  ``eval_kd_loss`` metric is removed.
- Reorganize custom CUDA / Triton kernels under ``modelopt.torch.kernels`` into ``common/attention``, ``quantization/{conv,gemm}``, and ``sparsity/attention``. High-level APIs (``mtq.quantize``, ``mtsa.sparsify``, etc.) are unchanged, but **any code importing directly from the kernel subpackages must be updated**: there is no backwards-compatibility shim; the old import paths will raise ``ImportError`` / ``ModuleNotFoundError``. Migration table:

  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels import IS_AVAILABLE, attention, attention_calibrate, register_triton_attention`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.triton_fa import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.hf_triton_attention import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.hf_triton_attention import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.quantization.triton import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.quantization.gemm import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.quantization.src.conv.implicit_gemm_cuda import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.quantization.conv.implicit_gemm_cuda import ...``
  - ``from modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity.kernels import ...`` → ``from modelopt.torch.kernels.sparsity.attention import ...``

- Deprecated GradNAS pruning algorithm as it is not actively maintained and supports very limited and old models. It is recommended to use Minitron or Puzzletron pruning for LLM models. Also deprecates related ``examples/chained_optimizations`` directory.
- Model-specific PTQ ``quant_cfg`` adjustments previously hardcoded in ``examples/llm_ptq/`` (``build_quant_cfg`` / ``mono_quantize``) for gemma, mpt, phi4mm, and Nemotron VL are now opt-in **model-specific recipes** under ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/``. Any adjustment specific to a model type or instance must live in that model's recipe; the bare ``--qformat`` path produces only the generic numerics. Pass ``--recipe huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/<recipe>`` to apply the model's recipe. Covers gemma/mpt ``w4a8_awq`` (``awq_lite`` ``alpha_step=1``), gemma ``int8_sq`` (SmoothQuant ``alpha=0.5``), phi4mm speech/audio/image/vision exclusions, and Nemotron VL vision-branch exclusions. All shipped recipes also enable FP8 KV-cache cast. MTP dynamic layer exclusion and ``is_nemotron_vl`` detection remain in Python.
- The Step3.5-Flash recipe moved from ``modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml`` (0.44) to ``modelopt_recipes/huggingface/step3p5/Step3.5-Flash/ptq/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml`` to match the ``huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/`` layout convention. Update ``--recipe`` paths accordingly.

**Deprecations**

- Deprecate the public ``QuantizationArgumentsWithConfig`` name in ``modelopt.torch.quantization.plugins.transformers_trainer``; it now aliases ``QuantizationArguments`` and will be removed in a future release.
- Deprecate ``examples/llm_autodeploy``. The AutoQuant + TensorRT-LLM AutoDeploy
  workflow it demonstrates will be removed in a future release; use TensorRT-LLM's
  `AutoDeploy <https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/tree/main/examples/auto_deploy>`_
  directly together with ModelOpt PTQ in ``examples/llm_ptq``.

**Bug Fixes**

- Support non-gated fused MoE experts in unified HuggingFace export. Nemotron-H MoE models (transformers 5.x ``NemotronHExperts``) store experts as fused 3-D ``up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` parameters with no ``gate_up_proj``; the fused-experts detection previously keyed on ``gate_up_proj``, so these were never wrapped as ``_QuantFusedExperts`` and export raised ``NotImplementedError: MoE model with experts type 'NemotronHExperts' is not supported``. The fused-experts path now also recognizes the non-gated layout (new ``_QuantNonGatedFusedExperts``) and exports a single ``up_proj`` per expert; the gated path is unchanged.
- In Megatron-Core only do EP amax sync for routed expert weights if ``sync_expert_weight_amax=True``. Previously EP amax sync would sync routed expert weights across EP ranks even when ``sync_expert_weight_amax`` was False.
- Fix Megatron-Core HF importer to load fused ``TELayerNormColumnParallelLinear.layer_norm_weight`` from HF for GPT-family models (Qwen3 etc.) under ``--export-default-te-spec``. Importer now prefers per-context keys ``fused_input_layernorm`` / ``fused_pre_mlp_layernorm`` (fallback ``fused_norm`` for Nemotron-H backward compatibility); ``mcore_qwen.py`` provides the new rules. Without this fix, post-prune MMLU sat at chance.
- Fix ONNX AutoCast ``keep_io_types=True`` sanity-check failure (``Unexpected type in I/O tensor ...``) when a network input/output is an empty tensor (a dimension of size 0). Such tensors were "fake-cast" (retyped in place) to the low precision type; because the value-info map aliases the ``graph.input``/``graph.output`` ``ValueInfoProto``, this silently changed the model's I/O type. AutoCast now inserts a real ``Cast`` for protected I/O tensors instead.
- Fix INT8 entropy calibration of fp16 ONNX models raising ``ValueError: Too many bins for data range`` on numpy >= 2.0. ``_collect_value`` in ``modelopt.onnx.quantization.ort_patching`` now casts the histogram range endpoints to Python float so bin edges are computed in float64, instead of inheriting the fp16 dtype of an activation tensor with a small range (which collapsed the 128-bin linspace under NEP-50 promotion).
- Fix the GPT-OSS MXFP4 → NVFP4 PTQ path in ``examples/llm_ptq/hf_ptq.py`` (used with ``--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4``). ``get_model`` now loads native MXFP4 checkpoints (``openai/gpt-oss-*``) dequantized to BF16 ``GptOssExperts`` via ``Mxfp4Config(dequantize=True)`` on a sequential device map. This fixes a CUDA illegal-memory access during the multi-GPU dequant load and the ``NotImplementedError`` for experts type ``Mxfp4GptOssExperts`` during unified HF export (the packed-kernel experts wrapper, used when the optional ``kernels`` package is installed, is unsupported by export); ``kernels`` is no longer required. The ``--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4`` step now also resolves a HF Hub ID ``--pyt_ckpt_path`` to its local snapshot directory instead of failing with ``FileNotFoundError``.
- Fix ``_QuantGptOssExperts`` / ``_QuantLlama4TextExperts`` static-block NVFP4 weight calibration raising ``ValueError: Input shape has changed`` during the calibration forward. These experts quantize their weights transposed (``_transposed_quantize``); ``iter_weights_for_calibration`` now yields the same transposed view so weight-only calibration and the forward agree on the block-quant shape (and the export ``_amax`` orientation).
- Fix unified HF checkpoint export for Llama4 MoE models. The uncalibrated-experts input-quantizer ``amax`` fallback in ``_export_transformers_checkpoint`` special-cased only ``QuantGptOssExperts``; ``QuantLlama4TextExperts`` uses the same fused ``gate_up_proj`` / ``down_proj`` layout and is now handled by the same branch, fixing the export failure.
- Fix ``NotImplementedError: "max_all_cuda" not implemented for 'Float8_e4m3fn'`` during quantization calibration of models with natively FP8 (``float8_e4m3fn`` / ``float8_e5m2``) weights, such as DeepSeek-V3. FP8 dtypes implement no reduction (``max``/``amax``), ``abs``, or elementwise ``maximum`` kernels, so ``reduce_amax`` now upcasts FP8 inputs to the default float dtype before reducing; the upcast is lossless and only affects the FP8 path.

0.44 (2026-05-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**New Features**

- Add model-agnostic `Liger kernel <https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel>`_ fused loss support in ``ModelOptHFTrainer`` for any HuggingFace causal LM, with distributed param gathering for FSDP2, DeepSpeed ZeRO-3, and DDP. Extends HuggingFace's built-in Liger integration which is limited to `a fixed set of model architectures <https://github.com/linkedin/Liger-Kernel/blob/main/src/liger_kernel/transformers/monkey_patch.py>`_, FSDP only, and CrossEntropy loss. ModelOpt additionally supports Liger fused KD loss (JSD) for knowledge distillation.
- Add ``ModelOptTrainerArguments`` to ``ModelOptHFTrainer`` with ``--trainable_params``, ``--frozen_params``, ``--lr_config``, and ``--manual_gc`` flags. Add per-parameter learning rate support via YAML config. Saved checkpoints preserve the model's original dtype in ``config.json``.
- Simplify ``KDTrainer`` for HuggingFace knowledge distillation: remove ``mtd.convert()`` class-swap in favor of explicit teacher forwarding with logit-level distillation support.
- Support full Transformer Engine spec for Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``). Now we no longer need to use custom ModelOpt spec. Note that this does not affect the usage of the pruning workflow but makes pruning slightly faster and may result in slightly different pruned model because of different kernel and numerics.
- Add end-to-end tutorial for Minitron pruning + distillation + quantization + evaluation + vLLM deployment for Nemotron-Nano-9B-v2 → Pruned 7B along with data blend preparation steps (and ablation study). See `examples/pruning/minitron/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning/minitron/>`_ for details.
- Add Puzzletron - a new algorithm for heterogeneous pruning of LLM and VLM models. See `examples/puzzletron/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/puzzletron>`_ for more details.
- Added iterator interface using CalibrationDataReader in ONNX quantization workflow.
- Add N:M sparse softmax support to the Triton flash attention kernel (``modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa``). See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add skip-softmax skipping to the Triton flash attention kernel for both language models and video diffusion models (``modelopt.torch.kernels.common.attention.triton_fa``). See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ and `examples/diffusers/sparsity/ <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/diffusers/sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add Video Sparse Attention (VSA) method for video diffusion models (``modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity``). VSA uses 3D block tiling with a two-branch architecture for attention speedup.
- Enable PTQ workflow for the Step3.5-Flash MoE model with NVFP4 W4A4 + FP8 KV cache quantization. See `modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/models/Step3.5-Flash/nvfp4-mlp-only.yaml>`_ for more details.
- Add support for vLLM fakequant reload using ModelOpt state for HF models. See `examples/vllm_serve/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/vllm_serve#load-qatptq-model-and-serve-in-vllm-wip>`_ for more details.
- [Early Testing] Add Claude Code PTQ skill (``.claude/skills/ptq/``) for agent-assisted post-training quantization. The skill guides the agent through environment detection, model support checking, format selection, and execution via the launcher or manual SLURM/Docker/bare GPU paths. Includes handling for unlisted models with custom module patching. This feature is in early testing — use with caution.
- [Early Testing] Polish Claude Code evaluation skill (``.claude/skills/evaluation/``) for agent-assisted LLM accuracy benchmarking via NeMo Evaluator Launcher. Adds two companion skills vendored verbatim from `NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator <https://github.com/NVIDIA-NeMo/Evaluator>`_: ``launching-evals`` (run/check/debug/analyze NEL evaluations) and ``accessing-mlflow`` (query MLflow runs, compare metrics, fetch artifacts). Re-sync at a pinned upstream SHA via ``.claude/scripts/sync-upstream-skills.sh``. Also adds a shared ``skills/common/credentials.md`` covering HF / NGC / Docker token setup referenced by multiple skills. This feature is in early testing — use with caution.
- Add performant layerwise calibration for large models that don't fit on GPU (e.g. DeepSeek-R1, Kimi-K2). See `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_experts_only-kv_fp8_layerwise.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_experts_only-kv_fp8_layerwise.yaml>`_ for usage. Layerwise calibration also supports PTQ with intermediate progress saving — useful when long PTQ runs get hit with Slurm timeouts. See `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_default-kv_none-gptq.yaml <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/blob/main/modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/nvfp4_default-kv_none-gptq.yaml>`_ for usage.
- Add implicit GEMM CUDA kernel for Conv3D with fused NVFP4 fake quantization (``modelopt.torch.quantization.src.conv``). When NVFP4 quantization is applied to an ``nn.Conv3d`` layer via ModelOpt PTQ, the implicit GEMM path is used automatically instead of cuDNN. Uses BF16 WMMA tensor cores (SM80+) with FP32 accumulation and in-kernel FP4 (E2M1) activation quantization. Grouped convolution (``groups > 1``) falls back to the default cuDNN path. Inference only — training mode falls back to cuDNN with a warning.
- Add FP8 MHA quantization support for vision transformers. Adds an attention-aware ONNX post-processing pass (scale Mul / K-transpose move before Q, Q→DQ insertion on softmax output) in :class:`FP8QuantExporter <modelopt.onnx.export.fp8_exporter.FP8QuantExporter>`, per-instance nested-attention-wrapper skipping in the HF plugin, and ``nn.LayerNorm`` registration in ``QuantModuleRegistry`` so BMM input quantizers and LayerNorm output quantizers defined in FP8_DEFAULT_CFG are honored end-to-end. See `examples/torch_onnx/torch_quant_to_onnx.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/torch_onnx/torch_quant_to_onnx.py>`_ for the general timm-model quantize→ONNX workflow.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- The ``quant_cfg`` field in quantization configs is now an **ordered list** of ``QuantizerCfgEntry`` dicts instead of a flat dictionary. Each entry specifies a ``quantizer_name`` wildcard, an optional ``parent_class`` filter, a ``cfg`` dict of quantizer attributes, and/or an ``enable`` flag. Entries are applied in list order with later entries overriding earlier ones. The old dict-based format is still accepted and automatically converted via ``normalize_quant_cfg_list()``, but now emits a ``DeprecationWarning``; new code should use the list format. All built-in configs (e.g. ``FP8_DEFAULT_CFG``, ``INT4_AWQ_CFG``, ``NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG``), examples, and YAML recipes have been updated. See the :ref:`quant-cfg` documentation for the new format reference and migration guide.
- Deprecated Mllama (Llama 3.2 Vision) support in the ``llm_ptq`` and ``vlm_ptq`` examples. The ``model_type == "mllama"`` branches and ``MllamaImageProcessor`` usage have been removed from ``hf_ptq.py`` and ``example_utils.py``. For image-text calibration of VLMs, use ``--calib_with_images`` with a supported VLM (see Nemotron VL section in ``examples/llm_ptq/README.md``).

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix Megatron utility functions for generation (with pipeline parallelism) and ~10x speedup in MMLU score evaluation (by batching prefill passes).
- Fix Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``) for MoE models. Importance estimation hooks were incorrectly registered for MoE modules and NAS step was hanging before this.
- Fix TRT support for remote autotuning in ONNX Autotune from 10.16+ to 10.15+ and fix TRT versioning check to the ``trtexec`` version instead of the TRT Python API when using ``trtexec`` backend.
- Exclude MatMul/Gemm nodes with K or N < 16 from ONNX INT8 and FP8 quantization. Such small-dimension GEMMs cannot efficiently use INT8/FP8 Tensor Cores and the added Q/DQ layers cause perf regressions in TensorRT. Honors Gemm ``transB`` when deriving K.
- Fix ``nvfp4_awq`` export ``AssertionError: Modules have different quantization formats`` for MoE models (e.g. Qwen3-30B-A3B) when some experts are not exercised by the calibration data. ``awq_lite`` now applies a neutral all-ones ``pre_quant_scale`` to any expert that ends up disabled (no cache-pass tokens, NaN scales, or no search-pass tokens) so its format remains ``nvfp4_awq``, consistent with the rest of the MoE block. A warning is emitted whenever this fallback fires.

**Misc**

- [Security] Changed the default of ``weights_only`` to ``True`` in ``torch.load`` for secure checkpoint loading. If you need to load a checkpoint that requires unpickling arbitrary objects, first register the class in ``torch.serialization.add_safe_globals([cls])`` before loading. Added :meth:`safe_save <modelopt.torch.utils.serialization.safe_save>` and :meth:`safe_load <modelopt.torch.utils.serialization.safe_load>` API to save and load checkpoints securely.
- Bump minimum required PyTorch version to 2.8.
- [Experimental] Add support for transformers>=5.0, including generic PTQ and unified HF checkpoint export for fused MoE expert modules (Mixtral, Qwen2-MoE, Qwen3-MoE, Qwen3.5-MoE, DeepSeek-V3, Jamba, OLMoE, etc.).
- Improve ``megatron_preprocess_data``: add ``--reasoning_content`` support for Nemotron v3 datasets, eliminate intermediate JSONL for HuggingFace datasets, return output file prefixes from the Python API, add gzip input support (``.jsonl.gz``), add ``--strip_newlines`` flag for plain-text pretraining data, add ``--hf_streaming`` for very large datasets (only consumed rows downloaded), and auto-shuffle when ``--hf_max_samples_per_split`` is set to avoid biased sampling.
- Add installation support for Python 3.14. Only basic unit tests are verified for now. Production usage still defaults to Python 3.12. Python 3.10 support will be dropped in the next release.

0.43 (2026-04-16)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Bug Fixes**

- ONNX Runtime dependency upgraded to 1.24 to solve missing graph outputs when using the TensorRT Execution Provider.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Default ``--kv_cache_qformat`` in ``hf_ptq.py`` changed from ``fp8`` to ``fp8_cast``. Existing scripts that rely on the default will now skip KV cache calibration and use a constant amax instead. To restore the previous calibrated behavior, explicitly pass ``--kv_cache_qformat fp8``.
- Removed KV cache scale clamping (``clamp_(min=1.0)``) in the HF checkpoint export path. Calibrated KV cache scales below 1.0 are now exported as-is. If you observe accuracy degradation with calibrated KV cache (``--kv_cache_qformat fp8`` or ``nvfp4``), consider using the casting methods (``fp8_cast`` or ``nvfp4_cast``) instead.

**New Features**

- Add ``fp8_cast`` and ``nvfp4_cast`` modes for ``--kv_cache_qformat`` in ``hf_ptq.py``. These use a constant amax (FP8 E4M3 max, 448.0) without data-driven calibration, since the downstream engine uses FP8 attention math for both FP8 and NVFP4 quantization. A new ``use_constant_amax`` field in :class:`QuantizerAttributeConfig <modelopt.torch.quantization.config.QuantizerAttributeConfig>` controls this behavior.
- User does not need to manually register MOE modules to cover experts calibration coverage in PTQ workflow.
- ``hf_ptq.py`` now saves the quantization summary and moe expert token count table to the export directory.
- Add ``--moe_calib_experts_ratio`` flag in ``hf_ptq.py`` to specify the ratio of experts to calibrate during forward pass to improve expert coverage during calibration. Default to None (not enabled).
- Add sparse attention optimization for transformer models (``modelopt.torch.sparsity.attention_sparsity``). This reduces computational cost by skipping attention computation. Supports calibration for threshold selection on HuggingFace models. See `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity>`_ for usage.
- Add support for rotating the input before quantization for RHT.
- Add support for advanced weight scale search for NVFP4 quantization and its export path.
- Enable PTQ workflow for Qwen3.5 MoE models.
- Enable PTQ workflow for the Kimi-K2.5 model.
- Add ``nvfp4_omlp_only`` quantization format for NVFP4 quantization. This is similar to ``nvfp4_mlp_only`` but also quantizes the output projection layer in attention.
- Add ``nvfp4_experts_only`` quantization config that targets only MoE routed expert layers (excluding shared) with NVFP4 quantization.
- ``pass_through_bwd`` in the quantization config is now default to True. Please set it to False if you want to use STE with zeroed outlier gradients for potentially better QAT accuracy.
- Add :meth:`compute_quantization_mse <modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.compute_quantization_mse>` API to measure per-quantizer mean-squared quantization error, with flexible wildcard and callable filtering.
- **Autotune**: New tool for automated Q/DQ (Quantize/Dequantize) placement optimization for ONNX models. Uses TensorRT latency measurements to choose insertion schemes that minimize inference time. Discovers regions automatically, groups them by structural pattern, and tests multiple Q/DQ schemes per pattern. Supports INT8 and FP8 quantization, pattern cache for warm-start on similar models, checkpoint/resume, and importing patterns from an existing QDQ baseline. CLI: ``python -m modelopt.onnx.quantization.autotune``. See the Autotune guide in the documentation.
- Add ``get_auto_quantize_config`` API to extract a flat quantization config from ``auto_quantize`` search results, enabling re-quantization at different effective bit targets without re-running calibration.
- Improve ``auto_quantize`` checkpoint/resume: calibration state is now saved and restored across runs, avoiding redundant calibration when resuming a search.
- Add support for Nemotron-3 (NemotronHForCausalLM) model quantization and support for NemotronH MoE expert support in ``auto_quantize`` grouping and scoring rules.
- Add support for block-granular RHT for non-power-of-2 dimensions.
- Replace modelopt FP8 QDQ nodes with native ONNX QDQ nodes.

**Deprecations**

- Removed MT-Bench (FastChat) support from ``examples/llm_eval``. The ``run_fastchat.sh`` and ``gen_model_answer.py`` scripts have been deleted, and the ``mtbench`` task has been removed from the ``llm_ptq`` example scripts.
- Remove deprecated NeMo-2.0 Framework references.

**Misc**

- Migrated project metadata from ``setup.py`` to a fully declarative ``pyproject.toml``.
- Enable experimental Python 3.13 wheel support and unit tests in CI/CD.

0.42 (2026-03-10)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix calibration data generation with multiple samples in the ONNX workflow.

**New Features**

- Add standalone type inference option (``--use_standalone_type_inference``) in ONNX AutoCast as an alternative to ONNX's ``infer_shapes``. This experimental feature performs type-only inference without shape inference, useful as a workaround when shape inference fails or to avoid unnecessary shape inference overhead.
- Add support for Kimi K2 Thinking model quantization from the original int4 checkpoint.
- Add support for ``params`` constraint based automatic neural architecture search in Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``) as an alternative to manual pruning (using ``export_config``). See `examples/pruning/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/pruning>`_ for more details on its usage.
- New example for Minitron pruning with Megatron-Bridge framework along with advanced pruning usage with new ``params`` constraint based pruning. Also add example for distillation with Megatron-Bridge framework. Check `examples/megatron_bridge/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/megatron_bridge>`_ for example scripts.
- Add support for calibration data with multiple samples in ``npz`` format in the ONNX Autocast workflow.
- Add ``--opset`` option to ONNX quantization CLI to specify the target opset version for the quantized model.
- Add support for context parallelism in Eagle speculative decoding for huggingface and megatron core models.
- Add unified Hugging Face export support for diffusers pipelines/components.
- Add LTX-2 and Wan2.2 (T2V) support in the diffusers quantization workflow.
- Add PTQ support for GLM-4.7, including loading MTP layer weights from a separate ``mtp.safetensors`` file and export as-is.
- Add support for image-text data calibration in PTQ for Nemotron VL models.
- Add support for advanced weight scale search for NVFP4 quantization and its export path.
- Add PTQ support for Nemotron Parse.
- Add distillation support for LTX-2. See `examples/diffusers/distillation/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/diffusers/distillation>`_ for more details.

0.41 (2026-01-19)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Bug Fixes**

**New Features**

- Add support for Transformer Engine quantization for Megatron Core models.
- Add support for Qwen3-Next model quantization.
- Add support for dynamically linked TensorRT plugins in the ONNX quantization workflow.

- Add support for subgraphs in ONNX autocast.
- Add support for parallel draft heads in Eagle speculative decoding.
- Add support to enable custom emulated quantization backend. See :meth:`register_quant_backend <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.tensor_quantizer.register_quant_backend>`` for more details. See an example in ``tests/unit/torch/quantization/test_custom_backend.py``.
- Add ``examples/llm_qad`` for QAD training with Megatron-LM.

**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``num_query_groups`` parameter in Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``). You can use ModelOpt 0.40.0 or earlier instead if you need to prune it.

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- Remove ``torchprofile`` as a default dependency from ModelOpt as its used only for flops-based FastNAS pruning (computer vision models). It can be installed separately if needed.

**Windows Support**

- Fix ONNX 1.19 compatibility issues with CuPy during ONNX INT4 AWQ quantization. ONNX 1.19 uses ml_dtypes.int4 instead of numpy.int8 which caused CuPy failures.
- Add support for ONNX Mixed Precision Weight-only quantization using INT4 and INT8 precisions. Refer quantization `example for GenAI LLMs <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/windows/onnx_ptq/genai_llm>`_.
- Add support for some diffusion models' quantization on Windows. Refer `example script <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/windows/torch_onnx/diffusers>`_ for details.
- Add `Perplexity <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/windows/accuracy_benchmark/perplexity_metrics>`_ and `KL-Divergence <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/windows/accuracy_benchmark/kl_divergence_metrics>`_ accuracy benchmarks.

- Fix Q/DQ/Cast node placements in 'FP32 required' tensors in custom ops in the ONNX quantization workflow.

**New Features**

- Add MoE (e.g. Qwen3-30B-A3B, gpt-oss-20b) pruning support for ``num_moe_experts``, ``moe_ffn_hidden_size`` and ``moe_shared_expert_intermediate_size`` parameters in Minitron pruning (``mcore_minitron``).
- Add ``specdec_bench`` example to benchmark speculative decoding performance. See `examples/specdec_bench/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/specdec_bench#speculative-decoding-benchmark>`_ for more details.
- Add FP8/NVFP4 KV cache quantization support for Megatron Core models.

- Add support for saving and resuming auto_quantize search state. This speeds up the auto_quantize process by skipping the score estimation step if the search state is provided.
- Add flag ``trt_plugins_precision`` in ONNX autocast to indicate custom ops precision. This is similar to the flag already existing in the quantization workflow.
- Add support for PyTorch Geometric quantization.
- Add per tensor and per channel MSE calibrator support.
- Added support for PTQ/QAT checkpoint export and loading for running fakequant evaluation in vLLM. See `examples/vllm_serve/README.md <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/vllm_serve#load-qatptq-model-and-serve-in-vllm-wip>`_ for more details.

**Documentation**

- Deprecate ``examples/megatron-lm`` in favor of more detailed documentation in `Megatron-LM/examples/post_training/modelopt <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/examples/post_training/modelopt>`_.

**Misc**

- NVIDIA TensorRT Model Optimizer is now officially rebranded as NVIDIA Model Optimizer. GitHub will automatically redirect the old repository path (``NVIDIA/TensorRT-Model-Optimizer``) to the new one (``NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer``). Documentation URL is also changed to `nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer <https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer>`_.
- Bump TensorRT-LLM docker to 1.2.0rc4.
- Bump minimum recommended transformers version to 4.53.
- Replace ONNX simplification package from ``onnxsim`` to ``onnxslim``.

0.39 (2025-11-11)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Deprecations**

- Deprecated ``modelopt.torch._deploy.utils.get_onnx_bytes`` API. Please use ``modelopt.torch._deploy.utils.get_onnx_bytes_and_metadata`` instead to access the ONNX model bytes with external data. see `examples/onnx_ptq/download_example_onnx.py <https://github.com/NVIDIA/Model-Optimizer/tree/main/examples/onnx_ptq/download_example_onnx.py>`_ for example usage.

**New Features**

- Add flag ``op_types_to_exclude_fp16`` in ONNX quantization to exclude ops from being converted to FP16/BF16. Alternatively, for custom TensorRT ops, this can also be done by indicating ``'fp32'`` precision in ``trt_plugins_precision``.
- Add LoRA mode support for MCore in a new peft submodule: ``modelopt.torch.peft.update_model(model, LORA_CFG)``.
- Support PTQ and fakequant in vLLM for fast evaluation of arbitrary quantization formats. See ``examples/vllm_serve`` for more details.
- Add support for ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2`` and ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v1`` in ``examples/llm_ptq``. Default to a mix of ``cnn_dailymail`` and ``nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2`` (gated dataset accessed using ``HF_TOKEN`` environment variable) if no dataset is specified.

- Add support for Nemotron Nano VL v1 & v2 models in FP8/NVFP4 PTQ workflow.
- Add flags ``nodes_to_include`` and ``op_types_to_include`` in AutoCast to force-include nodes in low precision, even if they would otherwise be excluded by other rules.
- Add support for ``torch.compile`` and benchmarking in ``examples/diffusers/quantization/diffusion_trt.py``.
- Enabled native Modelopt quantization support for FP8 and NVFP4 formats in SGLang. See `SGLang quantization documentation <https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang/blob/main/docs/advanced_features/quantization.md#using-nvidia-modelopt>`_ for more details.
- Added modelopt quantized checkpoints in vLLM/SGLang CI/CD pipelines (PRs are under review).
- Add support for exporting QLoRA checkpoint fintuned using ModelOpt.
- Update NVFP4 AWQ checkpoint export. It now fuses scaling factors of o_proj and down_proj layers into the model when possible to facilitate deployment.

**Documentation**

0.37 (2025-10-08)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Deprecations**

- Deprecated ModelOpt's custom docker images. Please use the PyTorch, TensorRT-LLM or TensorRT docker image directly or refer to the `installation guide <https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/getting_started/2_installation.html>`_ for more details.
- Deprecated ``quantize_mode`` argument in ``examples/onnx_ptq/evaluate.py`` to support strongly typing. Use ``engine_precision`` instead.
- Deprecated TRT-LLM's TRT backend in ``examples/llm_ptq`` and ``examples/vlm_ptq``. Tasks ``build`` and ``benchmark`` support are removed and replaced with ``quant``. ``engine_dir`` is replaced with ``checkpoint_dir`` in ``examples/llm_ptq`` and ``examples/vlm_ptq``. For performance evaluation, please use ``trtllm-bench`` directly.
- ``--export_fmt`` flag in ``examples/llm_ptq`` is removed. By default we export to the unified Hugging Face checkpoint format.
- Deprecated ``examples/vlm_eval`` as it depends on the deprecated TRT-LLM's TRT backend.

0.35 (2025-09-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``torch<2.6`` support.
- Deprecate NeMo 1.0 model support.

**Bug Fixes**

- Fix attention head ranking logic for pruning Megatron Core GPT models.

**New Features**

0.33 (2025-07-14)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- PyTorch dependencies for ``modelopt.torch`` features are no longer optional and ``pip install nvidia-modelopt`` is now same as ``pip install nvidia-modelopt[torch]``.

**New Features**

- Upgrade TensorRT-LLM dependency to 0.20.

0.31 (2025-06-04)
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

**Backward Breaking Changes**

- NeMo and Megatron-LM distributed checkpoint (``torch-dist``) stored with legacy version can no longer be loaded. The remedy is to load the legacy distributed checkpoint with 0.29 and store a ``torch`` checkpoint and resume with 0.31 to convert to a new format. The following changes only apply to storing and resuming distributed checkpoint.
    - ``quantizer_state`` of :class:`TensorQuantizer <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.modules.TensorQuantizer>` is now stored in ``extra_state`` of :class:`QuantModule <modelopt.torch.quantization.nn.module.QuantModule>` where it used to be stored in the sharded ``modelopt_state``.
    - The dtype and shape of ``amax`` and ``pre_quant_scale`` stored in the distributed checkpoint are now restored. Some dtype and shape are previously changed to make all decoder layers to have homogeneous structure in the checkpoint.
    - Together with megatron.core-0.13, quantized model will store and resume distributed checkpoint in a heterogenous format.
- auto_quantize API now accepts a list of quantization config dicts as the list of quantization choices.
    - This API previously accepts a list of strings of quantization format names. It was therefore limited to only pre-defined quantization formats unless through some hacks.
    - With this change, now user can easily use their own custom quantization formats for auto_quantize.
    - In addition, the ``quantization_formats`` now exclude ``None`` (indicating "do not quantize") as a valid format because the auto_quantize internally always add "do not quantize" as an option anyway.
- Model export config is refactored. The quant config in ``hf_quant_config.json`` is converted and saved to ``config.json``. ``hf_quant_config.json`` will be deprecated soon.


**Deprecations**

- Deprecate ``Python 3.9`` support.

**New Features**
