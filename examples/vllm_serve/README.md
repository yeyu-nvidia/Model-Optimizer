# Serve fakequant models with vLLM

This is a simple example to demonstrate calibrating and serving ModelOpt fakequant models in vLLM.

Compared with realquant, fakequant is 2-5x slower, but doesn't require dedicated kernel support and facilitates research.

This example is tested with vllm 0.9.0 and 0.19.1

## Prepare environment

Follow the following instruction to build a docker environment, or install vllm with pip.

```bash
docker build -f examples/vllm_serve/Dockerfile -t vllm-modelopt .
```

## Calibrate and serve fake quant model in vLLM

Step 1: Configure quantization settings.  
You can either edit the `quant_config` dictionary in `vllm_serve_fakequant.py`, or set the following environment variables to control quantization behavior:

| Variable        | Description                                      | Default             |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| QUANT_DATASET   | Dataset name for calibration                     | cnn_dailymail       |
| QUANT_CALIB_SIZE| Number of samples used for calibration           | 512                 |
| QUANT_CFG       | Quantization config                              | None                |
| KV_QUANT_CFG    | KV-cache quantization config                     | None                |
| QUANT_FILE_PATH | Optional path to exported quantizer state dict `quantizer_state.pth` | None |
| MODELOPT_STATE_PATH | Optional path to exported `vllm_fq_modelopt_state.pth` (restores quantizer state and parameters) | None |
| CALIB_BATCH_SIZE | Calibration batch size                           | 1                  |
| RECIPE_PATH      | Optional path to a ModelOpt PTQ recipe YAML  | None |

Set these variables in your shell or Docker environment as needed to customize calibration.

Step 2: Run the following command, with all supported flag as `vllm serve`:

```bash
python vllm_serve_fakequant.py <model_path> -tp 8 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

For vLLM versions that expose `--moe-backend`, this launcher defaults to `--moe-backend triton`.
ModelOpt expert fakequant needs a decomposed MoE backend so both expert GEMMs are visible during
calibration.

Step 3: test the API server with curl:

```bash
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/chat/completions"     -H "Content-Type: application/json"     -d '{
          "model": "<model_path>",
          "messages": [
              {"role": "user", "content": "Hi, what is your name"}
          ],
          "max_tokens": 8
        }'

```

Step 4 (Optional): using lm_eval to run evaluation

```bash
lm_eval --model local-completions --tasks gsm8k --model_args model=<model_name>,base_url=http://127.0.0.1:8000/v1/completions,num_concurrent=1,max_retries=3,tokenized_requests=False,batch_size=128,tokenizer_backend=None
```

## Load QAT/PTQ model and serve in vLLM (WIP)

Step 1: export the model with bf16 weights and quantizer state. To export the model:

- For **HF** models, use `examples/hf_ptq/hf_ptq.py` with `--vllm_fakequant_export`:

```bash
python ../hf_ptq/hf_ptq.py \
  --pyt_ckpt_path <MODEL_PATH> \
  --recipe <PATH_TO_RECIPE> \
  --calib_size 512 \
  --export_path <EXPORT_DIR> \
  --vllm_fakequant_export \
  --trust_remote_code
```

  This creates `<EXPORT_DIR>/vllm_fq_modelopt_state.pth` (ModelOpt quantizer state for vLLM fake-quant reload) and saves the HF-exported model under `<EXPORT_DIR>` (config/tokenizer/weights).

  Note: `--pyt_ckpt_path` can point to either an HF checkpoint or a ModelOpt-saved checkpoint (e.g., a QAT/QAD checkpoint produced by `examples/llm_qat/train.py`). If the input checkpoint is already quantized, the script will **skip re-quantization** and only export artifacts for vLLM fakequant reload.

- For **MCore** models, export the model with flag `--export-vllm-fq` as described in [Megatron-LM README](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/examples/post_training/modelopt#-nvfp4-quantization-qauntization-aware-training-and-model-export). This generates `quantizer_state.pth`, which contains quantizer tensors for vLLM reload via `QUANT_FILE_PATH`.

Step 2: use the exported artifacts when serving:

- **HF export**: pass the exported `vllm_fq_modelopt_state.pth` via `MODELOPT_STATE_PATH`

```bash
# HF
MODELOPT_STATE_PATH=<vllm_fq_modelopt_state.pth> python vllm_serve_fakequant.py <model_path> -tp 8 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

- **MCore export**: pass the exported `quantizer_state.pth` via `QUANT_FILE_PATH` and set `QUANT_CFG` to match the MCore quantization recipe

```bash
# MCore
QUANT_CFG=<quant_cfg> QUANT_FILE_PATH=<quantizer_state.pth> python vllm_serve_fakequant.py <model_path> -tp 8 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## Serve a model with sparse attention in vLLM

Apply ModelOpt sparse attention at serve time. The launcher replaces vLLM's `FlashAttentionImpl` with `ModelOptSparseAttentionImpl` (Triton kernel with paged KV cache support) on every attention layer right after model load.

The configuration is read from the checkpoint's `config.json` `sparse_attention_config` block, written by ModelOpt's HF export. The launcher restores calibrated skip-softmax metadata and N:M sparse-softmax metadata (`sparsity_n`, `sparsity_m`, `dense_sink_tokens`, `dense_recent_tokens`). Checkpoints exported with both metadata entries use ModelOpt Triton for sparse prefill launches; decode-only launches and launches without active sparse work delegate back to vLLM FlashAttention.

Workflow:

1. Calibrate and export the model with `examples/llm_sparsity/attention_sparsity/hf_sa.py`. This writes `sparse_attention_config` into the exported checkpoint's `config.json`.
2. Serve the exported checkpoint with `--enforce-eager` (CUDA graph capture is not yet validated with the sparse attention kernel — see Known Problems):

   ```bash
   python vllm_serve_sparse_attn.py <EXPORT_DIR> --enforce-eager -tp 8 --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

If the checkpoint has no `sparse_attention_config`, the worker logs a message and passes through — vLLM runs unchanged. Quant-only flows are handled by `vllm_serve_fakequant.py`; combined sparse + quant will land in a follow-up PR.

Limitations:

- vLLM V1 chunked prefill and prefix-cache suffix attention are supported by offsetting query positions into the longer KV span.
- CUDA graph capture is not validated yet — use `--enforce-eager`.

## Known Problems

1. **MCore reload does not use `MODELOPT_STATE_PATH`**; use `QUANT_FILE_PATH` and make sure `QUANT_CFG` matches the quantization recipe used for the original MCore model (otherwise quantizer keys/config won’t align).
2. KV cache quantization export and reload is not supported in MCore yet.
3. **`NVFP4_KV_CFG` and `NVFP4_AFFINE_KV_CFG` require `--enforce-eager`**; these configs use a dynamic-block Triton kernel for KV-cache quantization that is incompatible with CUDA graph capture (the kernel grid is computed from Python-level tensor shapes, which get baked in at capture time). Without `--enforce-eager`, the captured grid will be wrong for different batch sizes, producing incorrect outputs.
