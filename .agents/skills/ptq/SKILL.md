# ModelOpt Post-Training Quantization

Produce a quantized checkpoint from a pretrained model. **Read `examples/hf_ptq/README.md` first** — it has the support matrix, CLI flags, and accuracy guidance.

## Step 1 — Environment

Read `skills/common/environment-setup.md` and `skills/common/workspace-management.md`. After completing them you should know:

- ModelOpt source is available
- Local or remote (+ cluster config if remote)
- SLURM / Docker+GPU / bare GPU
- Launcher available?
- Which workspace to use

## Step 2 — Is the model supported?

Check the support table in `examples/hf_ptq/README.md` for verified HF models.

- **Listed** → supported, use `hf_ptq.py` (step 4A/4B)
- **Not listed** → read `references/unsupported-models.md` to determine if `hf_ptq.py` can still work or if a custom script is needed (step 4C)

## Step 2.5 — Check for model-specific dependencies

If the model uses `trust_remote_code` (check `config.json` for `auto_map`), inspect its custom Python files for imports not present in the container:

```bash
grep -h "^from \|^import " <model_path>/modeling_*.py | sort -u
```

**Known dependency patterns:**

| Import found | Packages to install |
| --- | --- |
| `from mamba_ssm` / `from causal_conv1d` | `mamba-ssm causal-conv1d` (Mamba/hybrid models: NemotronH, Jamba) |

If extra deps are needed:
- **Launcher (4B)**: set `EXTRA_PIP_DEPS` in the task's `environment` section — `ptq.sh` installs them automatically
- **Manual (4A)**: `unset PIP_CONSTRAINT && pip install <deps>` before running `hf_ptq.py`

## Step 3 — Choose quantization format

**First**, check for a model-specific recipe:

```bash
ls modelopt_recipes/models/ 2>/dev/null
ls modelopt_recipes/huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/ 2>/dev/null  # per-arch; <model_type> from local config.json (Hub ID: AutoConfig.from_pretrained)
```

If a model-specific recipe exists, prefer `--recipe <path>` — but **inspect its include/exclude patterns** rather than assuming (e.g. for VLMs, confirm the vision tower is actually excluded).

**If no model-specific recipe**, choose a format based on GPU (details in `examples/hf_ptq/README.md`):

- **Blackwell** (B100/B200/GB200): `nvfp4` variants
- **Hopper** (H100/H200) or older: `fp8` or `int4_awq`

Use `--qformat <name>` (e.g., `--qformat nvfp4`). Format definitions: `modelopt/torch/quantization/config.py`. General PTQ recipes in `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/` correspond to the same formats — `--qformat` is the simpler way to use them.

Before running PTQ, sanity-check the selected qformat/recipe against the model structure. Inspect the recipe's include/exclude patterns and summarize which layer groups will be quantized and approximately how many modules/layers match (attention projections, MLP projections, experts, etc.). If the match count is 0, or far smaller than expected for the model, stop and fix the recipe or ask the user before launching calibration.

**VLMs:** generic `*mlp*`/`*experts*` recipes also match the vision tower (`model.visual.*`); quantizing the ViT silently breaks image benchmarks. Use the `huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/` recipe or add `*visual*`/`*vision_tower*` excludes, then verify in Step 5 — see `references/checkpoint-validation.md`.

If the source checkpoint is already quantized and the requested recipe/config reduces quantization coverage, confirm that intent with the user before running. For example, if an FP8 checkpoint is used as input and the recipe excludes some layers so they would fall back to BF16 instead of staying quantized, call out the affected layer groups and ask whether that FP8-to-BF16 fallback is intended.

> NVFP4 can be calibrated on Hopper but requires Blackwell for inference.

## Step 4 — Run PTQ

**Goal: checkpoint on disk** (`.safetensors` + `config.json`).

For **listed models** (4A/4B): run full calibration directly (`--calib_size 512`).
For **unlisted models** (4C): run a smoke test first (`--calib_size 4`), wait for success, then full calibration.

### Which path?

```text
In README table? ─→ YES ──→ SLURM (local or remote)? ──→ LAUNCHER (4B)
                  │          Local Docker + GPU? ────────→ LAUNCHER (4B)
                  │          Remote Docker (no SLURM)? ──→ MANUAL (4A)
                  │          Bare GPU (local or remote)? → MANUAL (4A)
                  │
                  └→ NOT LISTED ──→ UNLISTED MODEL (4C)
```

### 4A — Direct: supported model, manual execution

```bash
pip install --no-build-isolation "nvidia-modelopt[hf]"
pip install -r examples/hf_ptq/requirements.txt

python examples/hf_ptq/hf_ptq.py \
    --pyt_ckpt_path <model> \
    --qformat <format> \
    --calib_size 512 \
    --export_path <output>
```

Run `--help` for all options.

For remote: use `remote_run` from `remote_exec.sh` (see `skills/common/remote-execution.md`).

### 4B — Launcher: supported model on SLURM or local Docker

Write a YAML config using `common/hf_ptq/hf_ptq.sh`. See `references/launcher-guide.md` for the full template.

```bash
cd tools/launcher
# SLURM (remote or local):
SLURM_HOST=<host> SLURM_ACCOUNT=<acct> uv run launch.py --yaml <config.yaml> user=<ssh_user> identity=<ssh_key> --yes
# Local Docker:
uv run launch.py --yaml <config.yaml> hf_local=<hf_cache> --yes
```

The launcher blocks and tails logs until the job completes. If the launcher fails (missing deps, config errors), fall back to path 4A (manual execution).

### 4C — Unlisted model

Follow `references/unsupported-models.md`. It walks through investigating the model, patching ModelOpt if needed, and running `hf_ptq.py`. Run manually (like 4A) for easier monitoring and debugging.

For SLURM, see `skills/common/slurm-setup.md` and `references/slurm-setup-ptq.md`.

### Monitoring

After job submission, register the job and set up monitoring per the **monitor skill**.

## Step 5 — Verify output

```bash
ls -lh <output_path>/
# Expect: config.json, tokenizer files, model-*.safetensors
```

Report the path and size to the user.

### Post-quantization validation

This is a required gate before any deployment or evaluation submission. Do not submit an eval, start a serving job, or hand off the checkpoint as ready until the gate has passed.

Read `references/checkpoint-validation.md` and perform all three validation groups on the exact checkpoint path that will be deployed/evaluated:

1. Check output size and estimated bits per weight against the baseline/source checkpoint.
2. Check quantized-weight coverage against the requested qformat/recipe/config.
3. Check metadata consistency against the baseline/source model.

Report the gate result before moving on. The report must include source size, output size, output/source size ratio, layer precision counts (for example NVFP4, FP8, INT4, BF16/unquantized excluded, unexpected unquantized, declaration mismatches), and metadata diffs. If the output/source ratio is >= 1.0 for a compression recipe, if any intended layer group is missing quantization, or if metadata changed unexpectedly, stop and fix the checkpoint or ask the user before proceeding.

**Next steps**: If the user wants to deploy or evaluate the quantized checkpoint, use the **deployment** or **evaluation** skill. The checkpoint workspace carries over. If the model required patches during PTQ (e.g., transformers upgrade), the same fixes will likely be needed at deployment and evaluation time.

## Key API Rules

- `mtq.register()` classes **must** define `_setup()` and call it from `__init__`
- Call `mto.enable_huggingface_checkpointing()` **before** quantization
- Wildcard `*gate*` matches too broadly — use `*mlp.gate*` or `*router*`
- VLMs: `hf_ptq.py` auto-extracts the language model via `extract_and_prepare_language_model_from_vl()` — no manual VLM handling needed in most cases
- FP8 checkpoints: prefer `_QuantFP8Linear` (lazy dequant) over `FineGrainedFP8Config(dequantize=True)` which wastes ~2x memory. See `references/unsupported-models.md` for details
- Custom quantizer names must end with `_input_quantizer` or `_weight_quantizer`

## Common Pitfalls

- **Model-specific dependencies**: Models with `trust_remote_code` may import packages not in the container (e.g., `mamba-ssm` for hybrid Mamba models). See Step 2.5. Use `EXTRA_PIP_DEPS` env var with the launcher, or install manually before running `hf_ptq.py`
- **Transformers version**: New models may need a newer version of transformers than what's installed. Check `config.json` for `transformers_version`. In containers, beware of `PIP_CONSTRAINT` blocking upgrades — see `references/slurm-setup-ptq.md` for workarounds
- **Gated datasets**: Some calibration datasets require HF authentication. Ensure `HF_TOKEN` is set in the job environment, or use `--dataset cnn_dailymail` as a non-gated alternative
- **NFS root_squash + Docker**: See `skills/common/slurm-setup.md` section 5
