# Post-training quantization (PTQ)

Quantization is an effective model optimization technique that compresses your models. Quantization with Model Optimizer can compress model size by 2x-4x, speeding up inference while preserving model quality.

Model Optimizer enables highly performant quantization formats including NVFP4, FP8, INT8, INT4 and supports advanced algorithms such as SmoothQuant, AWQ, SVDQuant, and Double Quantization with easy-to-use Python APIs.

This section focuses on Post-training quantization, a technique that reduces model precision after training to improve inference efficiency without requiring retraining.

## Getting Started

### 1. Quantize (Post Training Quantization)

With the simple API below, you can very easily use Model Optimizer to quantize your model. Model Optimizer achieves this by converting the precision of your model to the desired precision, and then using a small dataset (typically 128-512 samples) to [calibrate](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/guides/_basic_quantization.html) the quantization scaling factors. The accuracy of PTQ is typically robust across different choices of calibration data, by default Model Optimizer uses a mix of [`cnn_dailymail`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/abisee/cnn_dailymail) and [`nemotron-post-training-dataset-v2`](https://huggingface.co/datasets/nvidia/Nemotron-Post-Training-Dataset-v2). Users can try other datasets by easily modifying the `calib_set`.

```python
import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

# Setup the model
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("...")

# Simplified example set up a calibration data loader with the desired calib_size
calib_set = get_dataloader(num_samples=calib_size)

# Prepare the calibration set and define a forward loop
def forward_loop(model):
    for batch in calib_set:
        model(batch)

# PTQ with in-place replacement to quantized modules
model = mtq.quantize(model, mtq.NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG, forward_loop)
```

> *For higher NVFP4 PTQ accuracy, we recommend using `mtq.NVFP4_MLP_ONLY_CFG`, `mtq.NVFP4_EXPERTS_ONLY_CFG`, or `mtq.NVFP4_OMLP_ONLY_CFG` instead of `mtq.NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG`. `NVFP4_MLP_ONLY_CFG` applies NVFP4 quantization to MLP (and MoE) layers, leaving attention layers unquantized. `NVFP4_EXPERTS_ONLY_CFG` quantizes only expert layers (`*mlp.experts*` and `*block_sparse_moe*`), useful for MoE models where dense MLP and attention stay in higher precision. `NVFP4_OMLP_ONLY_CFG` additionally quantizes the `o_proj` layer. All preserve accuracy in the sensitive attention QKV projections while still providing significant compression.*

### 2. Export Quantized Model

Once your model is quantized, you can now export that model to a checkpoint for easy deployment. \
We provide two APIs to export the quantized model:

- Unified Hugging Face checkpoints, which can be deployed on TensorRT-LLM (Pytorch and C++ backends), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
- (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM checkpoints, a format that works with TensorRT-LLM C++ backend only.

#### Unified Hugging Face Checkpoints

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_hf_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
    )
```

Please reference our [framework scripts](#framework-scripts) and our [docs](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/guides/1_quantization.html) for more details.

## Framework Scripts

### Hugging Face Example [Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

For LLM models like [Llama-3](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama):

```bash
# Install model specific pip dependencies if needed

export HF_PATH=<the downloaded LLaMA checkpoint from the Hugging Face hub, or simply the model card>
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model $HF_PATH --quant <QFORMAT> --tp [1|2|4|8]
```

Supported `QFORMAT` values: `fp8`, `fp8_pc_pt`, `fp8_pb_wo`, `int8`, `int8_sq`, `int8_wo`, `int4_awq`, `w4a8_awq`, `nvfp4`, `nvfp4_awq`, `nvfp4_mse`, `nvfp4_mlp_only`, `nvfp4_experts_only`, `nvfp4_omlp_only`, `nvfp4_svdquant`, `nvfp4_local_hessian`, `w4a8_nvfp4_fp8`, `w4a8_mxfp4_fp8`, `mxfp8`.

> *By default `trust_remote_code` is set to false. Please turn it on if model calibration and eval requires it using `--trust_remote_code`.*

> *If the Huggingface model calibration fails on a multi-GPU system due to mismatched tensor placement, please try setting CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES to a smaller number.*

> *FP8 calibration over a large model with limited GPU memory is not recommended but possible with the [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/usage_guides/big_modeling) package. Please tune the device_map setting in [`example_utils.py`](./example_utils.py) if needed for model loading and the calibration process can be slow.*

> *Huggingface models trained with `modelopt.torch.speculative` can be used as regular Huggingface models in PTQ. Note: there is a known issue with Huggingface models loaded across multiple GPUs for inference (i.e., "Expected all tensors to be on the same device, but found at least two devices..."). When encountered this error in PTQ of speculative decoding models, try reducing the number of GPUs used.*

> *Calibration by default uses left padding_side for the Huggingface tokenizer as it usually leads to lower accuracy loss. The exported tokenizer files restores the default padding_side.*

> *If a GPU OOM error occurs during model quantization despite sufficient memory, setting the --use_seq_device_map flag can help. This enforces sequential device mapping, distributing the model across GPUs and utilizing up to 80% of each GPU's memory.*

> *You can add `--low_memory_mode` to the command to lower the memory requirements of the PTQ process. With this mode, the script will compress model weights to low precision before calibration. This mode is only supported for FP8 and NVFP4 with max calibration.*

#### Recipe-based Quantization

Instead of specifying `--qformat` and `--kv_cache_qformat` separately, you can use a **recipe** — a declarative YAML file that bundles the full quantization configuration. Recipes are loaded via `--recipe` and take precedence over `--qformat`.

```bash
# Using a built-in recipe name (without .yaml suffix)
python hf_ptq.py \
  --pyt_ckpt_path <huggingface_model_card> \
  --recipe general/ptq/nvfp4_default-kv_fp8_cast \
  --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path>

# Using a custom recipe YAML file path
python hf_ptq.py \
  --pyt_ckpt_path <huggingface_model_card> \
  --recipe /path/to/my_ptq.yaml \
  --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path>
```

Built-in recipes are located in `modelopt_recipes/general/ptq/` for model-agnostic recipes and in `modelopt_recipes/huggingface/<model_type>/ptq/` for recipes tuned to a specific Hugging Face `model_type` (see [`modelopt_recipes/huggingface/README.md`](../../modelopt_recipes/huggingface/README.md)). You can also provide a path to your own custom YAML recipe file or directory. See the [recipe documentation](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer) for details on the YAML schema and available recipes.

> *When `--recipe` is specified, `--qformat` and `--kv_cache_qformat` are ignored. The recipe fully defines the quantization configuration.*

#### KV Cache Quantization

KV cache quantization reduces memory usage during inference by quantizing the key-value cache. This is controlled via the `--kv_cache_qformat` flag (default: `fp8_cast`).

```bash
# FP8 KV cache with cast (no calibration needed, fast)
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path <model> --qformat fp8 --kv_cache_qformat fp8_cast --export_path <path>

# NVFP4 KV cache with data-driven calibration
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path <model> --qformat nvfp4 --kv_cache_qformat nvfp4 --export_path <path>

# Disable KV cache quantization
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path <model> --qformat fp8 --kv_cache_qformat none --export_path <path>
```

Via the shell script:

```bash
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model $HF_PATH --quant fp8 --kv_cache_quant nvfp4
```

Available KV cache formats:

| Format | Description |
| :---: | :--- |
| `fp8_cast` (default) | FP8 KV cache without data-driven calibration (amax set to FP8 range) |
| `fp8` | FP8 KV cache with data-driven calibration |
| `fp8_affine` | FP8 KV cache with affine quantization |
| `nvfp4_cast` | NVFP4 KV cache without data-driven calibration |
| `nvfp4` | NVFP4 KV cache with data-driven calibration |
| `nvfp4_affine` | NVFP4 KV cache with affine quantization |
| `nvfp4_rotate` | NVFP4 KV cache with rotation |
| `none` | Disable KV cache quantization |

> *Formats ending in `_cast` (fp8_cast, nvfp4_cast) are fast — they set the amax to the format's full range without data-driven calibration. Other formats use data-driven calibration for potentially better accuracy.*

#### MXFP4 → NVFP4 cast (for GPT-OSS)

GPT-OSS checkpoints (`openai/gpt-oss-20b`, `openai/gpt-oss-120b`) ship with native MXFP4 weights (`*_blocks` + `*_scales` in the checkpoint, `quantization_config.quant_method == "mxfp4"`). Passing `--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4` tells `hf_ptq.py` to read the source MXFP4 scales and produce a closed-form, bit-exact NVFP4 weight export — no GEMM-level recalibration of the weights needed.

```bash
python hf_ptq.py \
  --pyt_ckpt_path openai/gpt-oss-20b \
  --qformat nvfp4_mlp_only \
  --cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4 \
  --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path>
```

The cast pins each NVFP4 block's `scale_2 = 2^(k_max - 8)` and `_amax = 6 * 2^k_j`, both derived from the source MXFP4 E8M0 scales. For blocks whose `k_j` lands in E4M3's representable window (`k_max - k_j ≤ 17`), NVFP4 dequant matches MXFP4 dequant bit-for-bit; out-of-range blocks fall back to a data-derived per-block amax.

> *`--cast_mxfp4_to_nvfp4` requires an NVFP4-family `--qformat` (e.g. `nvfp4_mlp_only`, `nvfp4_experts_only`, `nvfp4`) and is incompatible with `--auto_quantize_bits`.*

#### Deepseek R1

[PTQ for DeepSeek](../deepseek/README.md) shows how to quantize the DeepSeek model with FP4 and export to TensorRT-LLM.

#### VLM quantization

Vision-language models are quantized through the same script. Add `--vlm` so the script runs the
TensorRT-LLM multimodal quickstart as the deploy smoke test instead of the text-only one:

```bash
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model <Hugging Face model card or checkpoint> --quant fp8 --vlm
```

Supported `--quant` values for VLMs are `fp8`, `nvfp4`, `int8_sq`, `int4_awq`, and `w4a8_awq` (see
the `(VLM)` rows in the [Support Matrix](#hugging-face-supported-models)).

> *This consolidates the former `examples/vlm_ptq` example, which now forwards here.*

#### VLM calibration with image-text pairs (e.g., Nemotron VL)

For vision-language models, calibration quality can likely improve by using image-text pairs instead of text-only data, especially on visual understanding tasks:

```bash
python hf_ptq.py \
  --pyt_ckpt_path <huggingface_model_card> \
  --qformat nvfp4 \
  --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path> \
  --trust_remote_code \
  --calib_with_images \
  --calib_size 512
```

The same flag is exposed by the shell script:

```bash
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model <model> --quant nvfp4 --vlm --calib_with_images --trust_remote_code
```

> Note: when `--calib_with_images` is set, `--calib_size` must be a single value, and the calibration dataset is nvidia/nemotron_vlm_dataset_v2.
This functionality is currently in beta and has been tested on `nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-Nano-12B-v2-VL-BF16`.

### Megatron-Bridge Example Script

Please refer to [examples/megatron_bridge/README.md](../megatron_bridge/README.md) for example scripts for PTQ / QAD with Megatron-Bridge which is generally more performant than the Hugging Face scripts.

### Megatron-LM Example Script

Megatron-LM framework PTQ and TensorRT-LLM deployment examples are maintained in the Megatron-LM GitHub repo. Please refer to the examples [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Megatron-LM/tree/main/examples/post_training/modelopt).

## AutoQuantize

[AutoQuantize (`mtq.auto_quantize`)](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/reference/generated/modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.html#modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.auto_quantize) is a PTQ algorithm which quantizes a model by searching for the best quantization format per-layer while meeting performance constraints specified by the user. `AutoQuantize` streamlines the trade-off of model accuracy and performance.

Currently `AutoQuantize` supports only `auto_quantize_bits` as the performance constraint (for both weight-only
quantization and weight & activation quantization). `auto_quantize_bits` constraint specifies the effective number of bits for the quantized model.

You may specify an `auto_quantize_bits` constraint such as 4.8 for mixed precision quantization using `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` & `FP8_DEFAULT_CFG`.
`AutoQuantize` will automatically quantize highly sensitive layers in `FP8_DEFAULT_CFG` while keeping less sensitive layers in `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` (and even skip quantization for any extremely sensitive layers) so that
the the final mixed precision quantized model has an effective quantized bits of 4.8. This model would give a better accuracy than the model quantized with vanilla `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` configuration since the more aggressive `NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG` quantization was not applied for the highly sensitive layers.

Here is an example usage for `AutoQuantize` algorithm (Please see [auto_quantize](https://nvidia.github.io/Model-Optimizer/reference/generated/modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.html#modelopt.torch.quantization.model_quant.auto_quantize) API for more details):

```python

    import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq

    # Define the model & calibration dataloader
    model = ...
    calib_dataloader = ...

    # Define forward_step function.
    # forward_step should take the model and data as input and return the output
    def forward_step(model, data):
        output =  model(data)
        return output

    # Define loss function which takes the model output and data as input and returns the loss
    def loss_func(output, data):
        loss = ...
        return loss


    # Perform AutoQuantize
    model, search_state_dict = mtq.auto_quantize(
        model,
        constraints = {"auto_quantize_bits": 4.8},
        # supported quantization formats are listed in `modelopt.torch.quantization.config.choices`
        quantization_formats = ["NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG", "FP8_DEFAULT_CFG"]
        data_loader = calib_dataloader,
        forward_step=forward_step,
        loss_func=loss_func,
        ...
        )
```

### AutoQuantize for Hugging Face models

`AutoQuantize` can be performed for Huggingface LLM models like [Qwen](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3-8B) / [Nemotron](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/NVIDIA-Nemotron-3-Nano-30B-A3B-BF16) as shown below:

[Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

```bash
export HF_PATH=<the downloaded LLaMA checkpoint from the Hugging Face hub, or simply the model card>
# --auto_quantize_bits specifies the constraint for `AutoQuantize`
# --quant specifies the formats to be searched for `AutoQuantize`
# NOTE: auto_quantize_bits cannot be lower than the number of bits for the smallest quantization format in --quant
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model $HF_PATH --quant nvfp4_mse,fp8 --auto_quantize_bits 4.75 --calib_batch_size 4
```

The above example perform `AutoQuantize` where the less quantization accuracy sensitive layers are quantized with `nvfp4_mse` (specified by `--quant nvfp4_mse`) and the more sensitive layers
are kept un-quantized such that the effective bits is 4.75 (specified by `--auto_quantize_bits 4.75`).

#### AutoQuantize Advanced Options

| Flag | Default | Description |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| `--auto_quantize_method` | `gradient` | Sensitivity analysis method. `gradient` uses gradient-based scoring (requires labels). `kl_div` uses KL divergence between original and quantized outputs (no labels required). |
| `--auto_quantize_score_size` | `128` | Number of samples for sensitivity scoring. Reducing this speeds up the search while only minimally affecting accuracy (compared to reducing `--calib_size`). |
| `--auto_quantize_checkpoint` | auto-generated | Path to save/restore search state (sensitivity scores, costs). Useful for resuming interrupted searches. |

```bash
# Use KL divergence method with smaller scoring set for faster search
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model $HF_PATH --quant nvfp4_mse,fp8 \
  --auto_quantize_bits 4.75 --auto_quantize_method kl_div --auto_quantize_score_size 64
```

The example scripts above also have an additional flag `--tasks`, where the actual tasks run in the script can be customized. The allowed tasks are `quant,mmlu,lm_eval,livecodebench,simple_eval` specified in the script [parser](./scripts/parser.sh). The tasks combo can be specified with a comma-separated task list. Some tasks like mmlu can take a long time to run. To run lm_eval tasks, please also specify the `--lm_eval_tasks` flag with comma separated lm_eval tasks [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks).

> *If GPU out-of-memory error is reported running the scripts, please try editing the scripts and reducing the max batch size to save GPU memory.*

> *NOTE: AutoQuantize requires backpropagation of the model. Models without backpropagation support (e.g., Llama-4) will not work with AutoQuantize when using the `gradient` method. The `kl_div` method does not require backpropagation.*

## Real Quant

When working with large language models, memory constraints can be a significant challenge. ModelOpt provides a workflow for initializing HF models with compressed weights across multiple GPUs to dramatically reduce memory usage. Check `--low_memory_mode` option in hf_ptq.py for more details.

```python
import modelopt.torch.quantization as mtq
from modelopt.torch.quantization.plugins import init_quantized_weights
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoConfig

# Step 1: Initialize the model with compressed weights
with init_quantized_weights(mtq.NVFP4_DEFAULT_CFG):
    model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(ckpt_path)

# Step 2: Calibrate the model
mtq.calibrate(model, algorithm="max", forward_loop=calibrate_loop)
```

## Multi-Node Post-Training Quantization with FSDP2

ModelOpt enables quantization of LLMs across multiple GPU nodes using various quantization formats. It leverages HuggingFace's Accelerate library and FSDP2 for distributed model sharding and calibration.

### Usage

For distributed execution across multiple nodes, use the `accelerate` library. A template configuration file (`fsdp2.yaml`) is provided and can be customized for user specific requirements.

On each node run the following command:

```bash
accelerate launch --config_file fsdp2.yaml \
    --num_machines=<num_nodes> \
    --machine_rank=<current_node_rank> \

The exported checkpoint can be deployed using TensorRT-LLM/ vLLM/ SGLang. For more details refer to the [deployment section](#deployment) of this document.

> *Performance Note: FSDP2 is designed for training workloads and may result in longer calibration and export times. For faster calibration, maximize the batch size based on available GPU memory and choose the right number of GPUs to avoid unnecessary communication.*

## Evaluate Accuracy

### TensorRT-LLM Validation

A list of accuracy validation benchmarks are provided in the [llm_eval](../llm_eval/README.md) directory. Right now MMLU is supported in this example by specifying the `--tasks` flag running the scripts mentioned above.

The `benchmark_suite.py` script is used as a fast performance benchmark. For details, please refer to the [TensorRT-LLM documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/benchmarks/)

This example also covers the [lm_evaluation_harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), MMLU and the human eval accuracy benchmarks, whose details can be found [here](../llm_eval/README.md). The supported lm_eval evaluation tasks are listed [here](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness/tree/main/lm_eval/tasks)

## Exporting Checkpoints

Model Optimizer supports provide two paths to export the quantized model:

- Unified Hugging Face checkpoints, which can be deployed on TensorRT-LLM (Pytorch and C++ backends), [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) and [SGLang](https://github.com/sgl-project/sglang).
- (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM checkpoints, a format that works with TensorRT-LLM C++ backend only.

The unified checkpoint<sup>1</sup> format design reflects two key characteristics: 1. The layer structures and tensor names remain aligned with the original Hugging Face checkpoint, and 2. The same checkpoint can be deployed across multiple inference frameworks without modification. A unified checkpoint can be exported using the following commands:

> *<sup>1.</sup>Unified checkpoint export currently does not support sparsity. Speculative decoding is only supported in unified checkpoint export. For legacy deployment, exported unified checkpoint then needs a TensorRT-LLM checkpoint converter (e.g., [this](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/eagle/convert_checkpoint.py)) to convert and build the TensorRT engine(s) for deployment. Alternatively, call TensorRT-LLM LLM-API to deploy the unified checkpoints e.g., check examples [here](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/examples/llm-api/README.md).*

### API

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_hf_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_hf_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
    )
```

### Quantize and Export

```bash
python hf_ptq.py --pyt_ckpt_path <huggingface_model_card> --qformat fp8 --export_path <quantized_ckpt_path> --trust_remote_code
```

> *For exporting fake-quantized models for vLLM serving (e.g., for research or kernels not yet supported in real-quant), use the `--vllm_fakequant_export` flag. See [vllm_serve/README.md](../vllm_serve/README.md) for details.*

### Hugging Face framework [Script](./scripts/huggingface_example.sh)

Alternatively, the framework script `huggingface_example.sh` also supports quantize and export:

```bash
scripts/huggingface_example.sh --model <huggingface_model_card> --quant fp8
```

### Deployment

### (Legacy) TensorRT-LLM Checkpoints

The user can specify the inference time TP and PP size and the export API will organize the weights to fit the target GPUs.

```python
from modelopt.torch.export import export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint

with torch.inference_mode():
    export_tensorrt_llm_checkpoint(
        model,  # The quantized model.
        decoder_type,  # The type of the model, e.g gpt, gptj, or llama.
        dtype,  # The exported weights data type.
        export_dir,  # The directory where the exported files will be stored.
        inference_tensor_parallel,  # The number of GPUs used in the inference time tensor parallel.
        inference_pipeline_parallel,  # The number of GPUs used in the inference time pipeline parallel.
        use_nfs_workspace,  # If exporting in a multi-node setup, please specify a shared directory like NFS for cross-node communication.
    )
```

### Build the TensorRT-LLM engines

After the TensorRT-LLM checkpoint export, you can use the `trtllm-build` build command to build the engines from the exported checkpoints. Please check the [TensorRT-LLM Build API](https://github.com/NVIDIA/TensorRT-LLM/blob/main/docs/source/architecture/workflow.md#build-apis) documentation for reference.

### Technical Resources

There are many quantization schemes supported in the example scripts:

1. The [FP8 format](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/nvidia-arm-and-intel-publish-fp8-specification-for-standardization-as-an-interchange-format-for-ai/) is available on the Hopper and Ada GPUs with [CUDA compute capability](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus) greater than or equal to 8.9.

1. The [INT8 SmoothQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438), developed by MIT HAN Lab and NVIDIA, is designed to reduce both the GPU memory footprint and inference latency of LLM inference.

1. The [INT4 AWQ](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00978) is an INT4 weight only quantization and calibration method. INT4 AWQ is particularly effective for low batch inference where inference latency is dominated by weight loading time rather than the computation time itself. For low batch inference, INT4 AWQ could give lower latency than FP8/INT8 and lower accuracy degradation than INT8.

1. The W4A8 AWQ is an extension of the INT4 AWQ quantization that it also uses FP8 for activation for more speed up and acceleration.

1. The [NVFP4](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/generative-ai-studio-ces-geforce-rtx-50-series/) is one of the new FP4 formats supported by NVIDIA Blackwell GPU and demonstrates good accuracy compared with other 4-bit alternatives. NVFP4 can be applied to both model weights as well as activations, providing the potential for both a significant increase in math throughput and reductions in memory footprint and memory bandwidth usage compared to the FP8 data format on Blackwell. For higher accuracy with NVFP4 PTQ, we recommend `nvfp4_mlp_only`, `nvfp4_experts_only`, or `nvfp4_omlp_only`. `nvfp4_mlp_only` restricts NVFP4 quantization to MLP (and MoE) layers only, leaving attention layers in higher precision. `nvfp4_experts_only` quantizes only expert layers (`*mlp.experts*` and `*block_sparse_moe*`), ideal for MoE models. `nvfp4_omlp_only` extends MLP-only by also quantizing the `o_proj` layer, providing a middle ground between full NVFP4 and MLP-only quantization.
